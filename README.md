### PyCity Schools Analysis

#### Overview
The PyCity Schools Analysis focuses on evaluating and comparing the performance of 15 schools within a school district. The analysis considers various factors, including student math and reading scores, school budgets, spending per student, school type, and school size. The goal is to identify the highest-performing schools and understand the factors that contribute to student success.

#### District Summary
- Total Schools: 15
- Total Students: 39,170
- Total Budget: $24,649,428
- Average Math Score: 78.99
- Average Reading Score: 81.88
- % Passing Math: 74.98%
- % Passing Reading: 85.81%
- % Overall Passing: 65.17%

#### Math and Reading Scores by Grade
- Breakdown of average math and reading scores by grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th) for each school.

#### Scores by School Spending
- Analysis of school performance based on per student budget. Schools are categorized into spending ranges, and statistics for average math score, average reading score, % passing math, % passing reading, and % passing overall are provided for each spending range.

#### Scores by School Size
- Analysis of school performance based on school size. Schools are categorized into size ranges (small, medium, large), and statistics for average math score, average reading score, % passing math, % passing reading, and % passing overall are provided for each size category.

#### Scores by School Type
- Analysis of school performance based on school type (charter or district). Statistics for average math score, average reading score, % passing math, % passing reading, and % passing overall are provided for each school type.

#### Conclusions
    • There is a correlation between the amount spent per student and the overall passing rate: in all categories (average math score, average reading score, percent passing math, percent passing reading, percent passing overall), less money spent on each student leads to higher scores and higher passing rates, and as spending increases per  student, scores and passing rates decrease accordingly.
• Overall, charter schools have a significantly higher academic success rate than district schools. 90.4% of charter school students pass both math and reading, whereas only 53.7% of district students pass both. Not only do more student pass math and reading in charter schools, but the average student scores for math and reading are higher than the averages of district school scores. Of the dataset, the schools with the highest averages and achievements are charter schools and spend less money than the district schools in the comparison. Charter schools spend an average of $606.40 per student, while districts schools spend an average of $646.60 per student.
